% INSTRUCTIONS:

% This script is written for GNU Octave or Matlab.

% The assignment is defined by conditions (a) to (g):
%
%  a) Submit an .m file as this one, with a script that works as a query-by-melody
%     program (a task similar to query-by-singing/humming). 
%
%  b) Submit the audio files used by the program or a link to download them.
%
%  c) The program to be submitted should at least do what is in Task 1 of 
%     the list below. If you feel this is too little challenge for you, you 
%     can do something of your own invention on top of Task 1. You can be 
%     creative on how to do this. You can get ideas from the course literature.
%     Alternatively, you can progress through the task list.
%
%  d) The program should not make use of any of the audio files used as 
%     example in class.
%
%  e) The program should not make use of any toolbox, but only the built-in
%     functions. Be sure to check this. There is plenty of documentation for 
%     Matlab and Octave on the internet.
%
%  f) The program should have clear instructions for the user.
%
%  g) Submitting a program that fulfills conditions (a) to (f) will be graded as
%     "PASS" for this assignment.

% TASK LIST:

% ..............................................................................

% Task 1) "Vanilla"
% Store a melody of at least 4 notes (e.g., in a cell array).
% Take as input at least two audio files, each of which is a different short 
% monophonic melody (i.e., only one human voice or instrument). One should match
% the stored melody. The program should tell which file corresponds to the stored
% melody. This program will tell if the stored melody and one of the inputs match 
% only if they are exactly the same sequence of notes.
% Audio can be recorded by you or downloaded from the internet, etc.
% A recommended source is freesound.org
% All the necessary knowledge to complete this task is contained in the following
% files:
%      matrices_multiplication_DEMO.m
%      loops_DEMO.m
%      find_DEMO.m
%      conditional_statements_DEMO.m
%      MIR_win_convo_autocorr_DEMO.m
% The files above and contact information if you need help, can be found at my 
% website: users.jyu.fi/~juigmend

% ..............................................................................

% Task 2) "Flexible Starter"
% Apart from what is included in "Vanilla", the program should be able to match
% the input melody as part of a longer stored melody. 

% ..............................................................................

% Task 3) "Flexible Plus"
% Apart from what is included in "Flexible Starter", the program should match 
% the input melody even if it is transposed with respect to the stored melody.

% ..............................................................................

% Task 4) "Flexible Extra"
% Apart from what is included in "Flexible Plus", the program should be tolerant
% to minor errors in the input melody.

% ..............................................................................

% Task 5) "MIR Madness"
% Apart from what is included in "Flexible Extra", the program should be able to
% create the stored melody from a monophonic audio file.

% ..............................................................................

% Task 6) "MIR Divinity"
% Apart from what is included in "MIR Madness", the program should be able to
% create the stored melody from a polyphonic audio file.
